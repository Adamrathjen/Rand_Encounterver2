# Overview

I wrote this program as a means of teaching myself how to write in the Kotlin programming language and better equip myself for future programming work.

This program is a simplified version of a random encounter engine used in a pen and paper role-playing game of my own design.  
The program will take in party size, location, and time of day to determine an appropriate encounter for the players.

# Development Environment

To begin I used IntelliJ IDEA Community but Android Studio is also a viable option.
I also used the latest Oracle JDK for compiling.

This whole program was written in Kotlin 
I imported a library to handle random number generation 
I also used the Scanner library to handle user input

# Future Work

* Expand potential random encounters and place on look up table
* Streamline location, time of day, and party size into a class to pass
* Provide a list of potential locations and potential encounters for each.
